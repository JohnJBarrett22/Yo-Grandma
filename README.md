Has your grandma ever wanted to get ahold of you but wasnt sure how to use her cell phone to dial you?
With "Yo! Grandma" your grandma can make sure you know she wants to talk to you.

With a single push of a button, grandma can message the people on her contact list via text, email or phone call (whatever type of notification the person has signed up for) to let them know they should call her.
